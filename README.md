# Quiz
This repository contains the source code for a quiz website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz website allows users to answer multiple-choice questions on various topics, with a timer and a score display. The quiz website is built using the following technologies:

HTML: This is used to create the structure and elements of the web page, such as the quiz container, the question, the options, and the buttons. CSS: This is used to style the web page and make it visually appealing and responsive. CSS properties such as font, color, margin, padding, and display are used to customize the appearance of the elements. JavaScript: This is used to handle the logic and functionality of the quiz website. JavaScript variables, functions, arrays, loops, and conditional statements are used to store the questions and options, display them dynamically, capture the user input, validate the answers, calculate the score, and provide feedback. The quiz website is designed to be interactive, engaging, and user-friendly. Users can start the quiz by clicking on the start button, and then proceed to answer the questions one by one. The quiz website also shows the remaining time and the current score at the top of the page. Users can submit their answers by clicking on the option they think is correct and then move on to the next question. If the answer is correct, the option will turn green and the score will increase. If the answer is wrong, the option will turn red and the correct option will be highlighted. At the end of the quiz, users can see their final score and restart the quiz if they want to try again. The quiz website is a fun and educational way to test your knowledge and learn new things.
